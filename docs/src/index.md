## Creating A URL Shortener

This is an in depth guide into building a url shortener using [Laravel](https://www.laravel.com). This will be used both to teach how to plan and execute a full stack project as well as be a primer to building robust web applications with Laravel.

This is still a work in progress, without a proper ending point but please feel free to go through what is available so far.
